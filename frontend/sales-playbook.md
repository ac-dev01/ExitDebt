# ExitDebt — Sales Playbook

## 1. Opening Lines for Sales Calls

> These open with empathy and listening — not a pitch.

1. **"Hi [Name], this is [Your name] from ExitDebt. Before I say anything, I'd like to understand — what's the one thing about your debt situation that frustrates you the most?"**

2. **"Hi [Name], I saw your report. You're overpaying quite a bit — but before I get into numbers, can I ask what made you check in the first place?"**

3. **"Hi [Name], I'll keep this short. I can see your numbers. But I want to start by hearing what's on your mind about your finances right now."**

## 2. Discovery Questions (Revealing Emotional Pain)

1. "When you look at your bank balance after EMI day, how does that feel?"
2. "Has your debt ever stopped you from doing something you really wanted to — a vacation, a purchase, helping family?"
3. "Do you ever worry about what happens if you miss an EMI?"
4. "Have you tried to fix this before? What stopped you?"
5. "If your EMI was ₹X less every month, what would that change for you?"

## 3. Transformation Close Statements

> Sell the outcome, not the service.

1. **"Right now you're paying [amount] more than you need to every year. We can change that — and you'll see the difference in your next EMI cycle."**

2. **"You came here because something felt wrong. Here's the good news — it's fixable. And we'll walk you through every step."**

3. **"Imagine opening your bank app next month and seeing [reduced EMI]. That's not a promise — that's what happens when we restructure at these rates."**

## 4. Calm Urgency Statements

> Time-bound but not pushy. No hard deadlines. No pressure.

1. "Lender rates change. The rates I'm seeing for you right now are strong — but I can't guarantee they stay this way past the month."

2. "Every month you wait, you lose another ₹[monthly overpayment]. There's no rush — but the math is real."

3. "If you'd like, I can lock in your options this week so you have time to decide. No commitment until you say 'go.'"

## 6. Friction Removal Suggestions

### Landing Page
- ✅ CTA says "Show Me My Savings" — clear, low commitment
- ✅ Added "Takes 30 seconds" to reduce time anxiety
- ✅ Added "We don't charge you. Ever." to kill pricing objection instantly
- ✅ Trust badges repositioned: PAN safety + CIBIL safety visible before form

### Results Page
- ✅ Savings shown in emotional terms (vacations, groceries, EMIs)
- ✅ Timeline added ("14–21 days if you act this week")
- ✅ Advisory section reframed as "what happens next" — not a sales pitch

### Callback Flow
- ✅ "No commitment required" — explicit pressure removal
- ✅ "15 minutes" time expectation — reduces unknown anxiety
- ✅ "We start by listening" — signals empathy before pitch
- ✅ Confirmation page says "No pressure. No judgment." — reinforces safety

### General
- Remove any instance of "might", "perhaps", "try to" from all future copy
- Never use passive voice ("savings may be found") — always active ("you save")
- Every CTA should tell the user what they'll SEE, not what they'll DO
- Keep every sentence under 20 words
- Test all copy with a 12-year-old readability check
