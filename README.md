## 💡 How It Works

```
PAN + Phone  →  CIBIL Pull  →  Full Dashboard (3mo free)  →  Lite/Shield Subscribe
```

1. **Enter PAN + Phone** — Verified via OTP
2. **Instant CIBIL Pull** — All loans and credit cards auto-populated
3. **Debt Health Score** — Proprietary 0–100 score (based on DTI, rates, utilization, history)
4. **Intelligence Tools** — Debt Freedom GPS, Interest Leak Report, Smart Payment Prioritizer, Salary Day Cash Flow, Credit Score Impact Predictor
5. **3-Month Free Trial** — Full Lite dashboard access, then tiered subscriptions

## 💰 Business Model

Tiered subscriptions + debt services:
- **Lite:** ₹499/month or ₹4,999/year (dashboard + 7 tools + monitoring)
- **Shield:** ₹1,999/month or ₹14,999/year (+ harassment protection + creditor negotiation)
- **Settlement:** 10% + GST on settled debt (₹1L+ minimum)
- **Lender Commissions** (Phase 2 — 0.5–3% on consolidation loans via DSA partnerships)
