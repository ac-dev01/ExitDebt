## 💡 How It Works

```
PAN + Phone  →  CIBIL Pull  →  Full Dashboard (3mo free)  →  ₹999/yr Subscribe
```

1. **Enter PAN + Phone** — Verified via OTP
2. **Instant CIBIL Pull** — All loans and credit cards auto-populated
3. **Debt Health Score** — Proprietary 0–100 score (based on DTI, rates, utilization, history)
4. **Intelligence Tools** — Debt Freedom GPS, Interest Leak Report, Smart Payment Prioritizer, Salary Day Cash Flow, Credit Score Impact Predictor
5. **3-Month Free Trial** — Full dashboard access, then ₹999/year to continue

## 💰 Business Model

₹999/year subscription after 3-month free trial. Additional revenue from:
- **Lender Commissions** (1–3% on consolidation loans facilitated by sales team via lending partners)
- **Lead Gen Fees** (₹500–₹2,000 per PAN-verified, CIBIL-enriched lead)
